    <h1>The First Sketchpad</h1>

    <p>
        <strong class="important">Ivan Sutherland</strong> is considered by many to be the creator of <strong class="important">Computer Graphics</strong> and an <strong class="important">Internet Pioneer.</strong> 
    <br> Starting with his Ph.D. thesis, named Sketchpad, which is one of the most influential computer programs ever written by an individual, Sutherland has contributed numerous ideas to the study of Computer Graphics and Computer Interaction. <br>
    He introduced concepts such as 3-D computer modeling, visual simulations, computer aided design (CAD), virtual reality, etc.
    How objects in Sketchpad could be visualized and modeled on a screen became the foundation for modern graphical computing used in <br> <strong class="important">Advertising, Business, Entertainment, Architecture, and Web Design.</strong> 
    In 1964 Sutherland collaborated with David Evan at the <strong class="important">University of Utah in Salt Lake City</strong> to initiate one of the first educational computer-graphics labs. <br>
    The Sketchpad also led to the advanced development of other imaging software, such as computer-aided design programs used by engineers. A Sketchpad user sketches directly on a computer display with a <strong><em> light pen.</em></strong> <br>The light pen is used both to position parts of the drawing on the display and to point to them to change them. A set of push buttons controls the changes to be made such as <strong><em> erase, </em></strong> <strong><em> move, </em></strong> etc. </br>
    </p>
<h1>How Does It Work?</h1> 

        <p><img src="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/specialfx2/images/sketchpad.jpeg" alt="sketchpad" width="400">
 <br>More information on how it works, the Sketchpad was the first program to have a graphic user interface. Using a light pen, users could draw directly on the screen. Information sketched can include straight line segments and circle arcs. <br>
Sketchpad itself is able to move parts of the drawing around to meet new conditions which the user may apply to them. The user indicates conditions with the light pen and push buttons.
For example, to make two lines parallel, you can point to the lines with the light pen and presses a button. The conditions themselves are displayed on the drawing so that they may be erased or changed with the light pen language. Any combination of conditions can be defined as a composite condition and applied in one step.

    <h1> Why Is It So Important? </h1>
        <img src="http://blog.businesssigns.net/img/2011/11/why.jpg" alt="questionmark" width="300">
   <p> While building the program in 1963 as part of his Ph.D. thesis, Sutherland also stumbled upon several enduring ideas in UI programming:

       <br> <strong>Method Dispatch</strong>: For each type of object, the program stored a block of operations specific to that type. Other parts of the program could just ask for a specific object to run a named operation, and the correct one would be chosen. <br>

       <br><strong>Generality</strong>: Each rewrite involved taking some part of the interface and code that was currently a separate case, and instead making it an instance of a generic part. Method dispatch helped make this possible. But the process also involved intensely clarifying the fundamental ideas behind the program to try to achieve a closed system, in which every available operation applied to as many different objects as possible. <br>

<br><strong>Prototypical Inheritance</strong>: Sketchpad allowed users to take an entire drawing and clone it into another. The master drawing could be updated and these changes would propagate throughout all clones. The clones were not stupid, either: they could include internal constraints or join-points that let them interact with the drawings they were used within. <br>

<br>Sutherland also faced challenges we no longer have. He had to modify the computerâ€™s operating system to support constantly getting input from the lightgun and constantly outputting to the screen. He had to write drivers for the input and output devices. And he made some advances to the way that basic shapes were rendered to the screen. <br>
