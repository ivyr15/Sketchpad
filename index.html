        <p> The Sketchpad (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) was a revolutionary computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the Turing Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in 2012. 
It pioneered the way for humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI). The Sketchpad was the first program to have a graphic user interface.
Using a light pen, users could draw directly on the screen. Prior to Sketchpad, no one had ever drawn engineering drawings directly on a computer display.
The Sketchpad allowed users to communicate the higher-level principles that defined their design, so that they could easily make changes and the system would automatically adjust the rest of the design, or other frames of an animation.
It may appear old-fashioned to our eyes today, but the Sketchpad was built upon concepts to which modern interface that are aspriring.
