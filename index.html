    <h1>The First Sketchpad</h1>

    <p id="main-paragraph" class="info-paragraph important">
    The Sketchpad Ivan Sutherland has made has pioneered the way for humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI). The Sketchpad was the first program to have a graphic user interface. 
    Using a light pen, users could draw directly on the screen. Prior to Sketchpad, no one had ever drawn engineering drawings directly on a computer display. 
    The Sketchpad allowed users to communicate the higher-level principles that defined their design, so that they could easily make changes and the system would automatically adjust the rest of the design, or other frames of an animation. 
    It may appear old-fashioned to our eyes today, but the Sketchpad was built upon concepts to which modern interface that are aspriring. </p>

    Ivan Sutherland is considered by many to be the creator of <strong class="important">Computer Graphics and an Internet pioneer.</strong>
    Starting with his Ph.D. thesis, named Sketchpad, which is one of the most influential computer programs ever written by an individual, Sutherland has contributed numerous ideas to the study of Computer Graphics and Computer Interaction.
    He introduced concepts such as 3-D computer modeling, visual simulations, computer aided design (CAD), virtual reality, etc.
